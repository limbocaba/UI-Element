# UI-Element

This site is a fanpage of the popular cartoon show "Rick and Morty" which displays photos of all 826 characters and thier basic information. This information includes name , location,species,gender and their life status.

You are able to scroll through multiple pages and scroll back to the ones you already saw using buttons.

This project included the use of mostly CSS to get the photos and buttons aligned and centered, and JavaScript to create functions and event listeners for the buttons and character containers.

This also needed the use of DOM Manipulation to access an API which is where all the information was accessed from.

A custom font was used by dragging an installed file into VSCode and referencing it on top of the CSS file.

This should work on all devices, please leave an issue if otherwise and it'll get resolved as soon as possible!
